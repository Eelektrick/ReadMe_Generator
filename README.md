# Process

First clone project from GitHub.

Next open the command line directly to thje file index.js.

Next type in: node index.js and press enter.

Next follow the steps and answer all questions.

After all questions have been answered the Read Me will be created.

# Issues

Only issue I ran into was remembering the terminology I used in the index.js file to match in the generate markdown

and personally aligning the question to how the information will show up on the read me.
